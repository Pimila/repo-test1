# Adding Code:

1. Create a new 'src' directory in your repository.
2. Choose a Java MOOC exercise and copy its related files into the 'src' directory.
3. Make a new commit (commits should only include C# file types).
4. Make a modification to the C# program and create a new commit (good commit message: present tense + imperative).
5. Edit the README file further...
6. Push your changes to the server.
